# Stress Meter

**Stress Meter** is an app designed to help users visually and audibly track their stress levels. The app currently displays a grid of images representing different stress levels. By clicking on an image, a corresponding sound is played to provide an auditory cue of the selected stress level.

## Features
- 🖼️ **Stress Level Grid**: A grid of images, each representing a different level of stress.
- 🔊 **Sound Feedback**: Clicking on an image plays a corresponding sound, enhancing the stress level experience.
- 📊 **Results Tab (Coming Soon)**: A future feature that will display a summary of your stress levels over time.
- 💾 **Save Function (Coming Soon)**: A feature that will allow users to save their results for later review.

## Current Status
- The app currently displays images but lacks a results tab and save functionality.
- The stress levels are represented by images, and the app plays sounds when an image is clicked.

## How to Use
1. Open the app.
2. Browse through the grid of images, each representing a different level of stress.
3. Click on an image to hear the sound associated with that stress level.

## Future Improvements
- Integration of the **Results Tab** to track and display your stress history.
- Ability to **save** your stress level results for future reference.
- Potentially adding more interactivity or features to track stress over time.
